# nodejs-based-project
Creating an application that uses the following stack: 
- nodejs for backend
- graphql or rest api for endpoint handling
- reactjs for frontend
- docker for containerization 
- mongodb for nosql like database
- github actions for ci/cd

Planning to use this project as a way to understand, and learn full stack development with certain devops principles. Basically creating an environment to deploy an application.
